## The idea
In an age of AI-driven content creation, the line between truth and fabrication is blurring at an alarming rate. Deepfakes, manipulated images, and synthetic media are flooding online platforms, and the average person is unequipped to tell fact from fiction.
This growing inability to discern reality poses a serious threat to public trust, informed decision-making, and democracy itself.
We aim to build an accessible, intuitive tool that empowers users to spot misinformation and verify visual data, giving everyone, not just experts, the power to fight digital deception.

## Mission specification
We’re building a lightweight Chrome extension that empowers users to verify information in real time.
For text, users can highlight a sentence and instantly receive a credibility breakdown: a curated summary of evidence, supporting or refuting the claim, drawn from reliable papers and websites. We display a “reliability percentage” alongside links to the original sources, helping users make informed judgments at a glance.
For images, our tool uses stactic analysis and a trained classification model to assess whether an image is AI-generated or authentic, flagging suspicious visuals in seconds.
