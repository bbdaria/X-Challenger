# X-Challenger

## The idea
Develop a chrome extension for challenging the post point of view 

## Mission specification
Due to the fact that the users are very lazy the usage should be as simple as possible - the user will hover over a post and a small popup will be created with links and challenging facts.

### Flow
* We shall have a list of suspicious sites like: instegram, facebook or twitter (etc.).
* Parse the message or post the user is looking at
* Search for opposite or confirming sources like government / news-papers / trusted organiztions.
* Link to the sites and create a short summary. 

How do we want to recognize text? the user doesn't need to copy and paste!
